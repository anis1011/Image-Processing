  "description": "This sample application takes an image or video frame of an analog gauge and reads the value using functions from the OpenCV\\* computer vision library. It consists of two parts: calibration and measurement.  During calibration, the application calibrates an image  of a gauge (provided by the user) by prompting the user to enter the range of gauge values in degrees.  It then uses these  calibrated values in the measurement stage to convert the angle of the dial into a meaningful value.",
